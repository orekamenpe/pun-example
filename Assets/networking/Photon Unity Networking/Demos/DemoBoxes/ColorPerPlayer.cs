/// It uses a Custom Property per player to store currently selected colors.
/// When a player joins and someone else didn't pick a color yet, this script waits.
/// When a color is selected or a player leaves, this scripts selects a color if it didn't do that before.
///
/// This could be extended to provide easy access to each player's color. Alternatively, you could write
/// extension methods for the PhotonPlayer class to access the Custom Property for colors in a seamless way.
/// See TeamExtensions for an example.
